##  Logistics-Delivery-Performance-Analysis
# Introduction:
This repository provides an overview of the Logistics-Delivery-Performance-Analysis project conducted using Python and an interactive Power BI dashboard depicting the key performance indicators related to delivery process. Delivery performance is analyzed by calculating Fill Rate, On -Time Delivery rate (OTD) and On -Time In Full (OTIF) rate. Analyzing these rates are  essential for business to improve operational efficiency and maintain customer satisfaction.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is related to a Logistics Industry.

# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook ,PDF containing Powerpoint Presentation and Power BI Dashboard.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we analyze logistics data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to delivery delay. Python is used for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to gain insights related to factors leading to delay in delivery and provide actionable recommendations to improve On-Time In Full deliveries.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-Learn 
- [Optional] Other libraries based on the analysis requirements.
- Power BI Desktop

# Analysis:
The analysis involves the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data's characteristics, exploring relationships between variables by performing both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and identifying potential patterns.
- Interpretation: Interpreting the analysis's results and identifying key factors contributing to delivery delay.
- Dashboard Creation: Creating an interactive dashboard with data visualizations to understand KPI'S 

# Results:
The results of the analysis will include:
- Visualizations illustrating key findings from the EDA and Power BI Analysis.
- Insights into factors influencing delivery delay.
- Recommendations for reducing delivery delays.

# Conclusion:

# KPIâ€™S 
- A high Fill Rate% of more than 99.5% shows efficiency in order processing
- OTD Rate is found to be 78.5% which is very low and indicates only 78.5 % orders are delivered on time
- On-Time In-Full (OTIF) rate is 78.1%, it means that approximately 78% of orders are being delivered both on time and in full
- Return rate seem to be slightly high with On-Time deliveries  but 75% of orders have 0 returns or fewer

# Delay Over Time 
- Delivery delays decreased from 22.32% in 2019 to 20.31% in 2020, which suggests a reduction in delay rates
- The highest delivery delay rate occurs in the month of November at 31% followed by April at 27%

# Performance Analysis
- Team North has Maximum delay in delivery
- All team excluding Team Ferrero has done diligent efforts to reduce delivery delays in 2020
- Among Service channels, Grocery Store exhibits the highest incidence of delivery delays
- Most of the service channels have shown improvement over the year 2020
- Salesperson 3818 has a high rate of delayed deliveries

# Most Affected
- Oklahoma City stands out as the city with the most pronounced delivery delays
- Customer identified by the ID number 52331 has encountered the highest number of delivery delays.
