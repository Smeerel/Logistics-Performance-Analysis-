##  Logistics-Delivery-Performance-Analysis
# Introduction:
This repository provides an overview of the Logistics-Delivery-Performance-Analysis project conducted using Python and an interactive Power BI dashboard depicting the key performance indicators related to delivery process. Delivery performance is analyzed by calculating Fill Rate, On -Time Delivery rate (OTD) and On -Time In Full (OTIF) rate. Analyzing these rates are  essential for business to improve operational efficiency and maintain customer satisfaction.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is related to a Logistics Industry.

# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook ,PDF containing Powerpoint Presentation and Power BI Dashboard.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we analyze logistics data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to delivery delay. Python is used for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to gain insights related to factors leading to delay in delivery and provide actionable recommendations to improve On-Time In Full deliveries.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-Learn 
- [Optional] Other libraries based on the analysis requirements.
- Power BI Desktop

# Analysis:
The analysis involves the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data's characteristics, exploring relationships between variables by performing both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and identifying potential patterns.
- Interpretation: Interpreting the analysis's results and identifying key factors contributing to delivery delay.
- Dashboard Creation: Creating an interactive dashboard with data visualizations to understand KPI'S 

# Results:
The results of the analysis will include:
- Visualizations illustrating key findings from the EDA and Power BI Analysis.
- Insights into factors influencing delivery delay.
- Recommendations for reducing delivery delays.
